# Inventory-Management-System

This project is a web-based Inventory and Billing Management System designed specifically for small and medium-scale Kirana (retail grocery) shops. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it provides a simple and efficient interface for shopkeepers to manage inventory, update item details, handle customer billing, and maintain daily sales counters â€” all in one place, without the need for advanced technical knowledge.

The system supports Telugu and English item names for easy accessibility, especially for local shop owners. It includes functionality for multiple price types (Cost Price, Retail Price, Wholesale Price, Special Price), admin-controlled inventory editing, dynamic quantity pricing, and a customer-named billing system.
